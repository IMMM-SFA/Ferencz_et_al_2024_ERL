Abstract: The interactions between population growth, urban morphology, and water demand have important implications for water resources and supply in urban regions. Outdoor water use for irrigation comprises a significant fraction of urban water demand, which is potentially influenced by long-term changes in urban morphology. To investigate this, we used spatially explicit projections of urban land development intensity (fraction impervious area) generated from a 30-m resolution urban growth model for the Los Angeles region. Recent historical data on water use and high resolution landcover data were used to establish relationships between green area, urban development intensity, and outdoor water demand. These relationships were then used to project outdoor and total water demand in 2100 using the urban growth model outputs. We considered two different population scenarios informed by the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) projections for the region (SSP3 and SSP5), and three scenarios of urban development intensification. We found that water demand growth in land constrained regions like Los Angeles significantly deviated from population growth, with lower water demand growth due to shrinking of green area. Our analysis is resolved for over 80 water providers in the region, from urban core to suburban fringe, and highlights diverse demand responses influenced by initial urban form and water demand attributes. Compared to previous studies, our work is unique in coherently linking high resolution SSP population scenarios, urban land cover evolution, and urban water demand projections, demonstrating the approach for the Los Angeles region â€“ the largest population center in the western United States.
