Input geospatial data needed for QGIS Model Builder:
1) 2019 NLCD raster (In folder Step 1a)
2) Hi resolution landcover raster (Download from doi: 10.17632/zykyrtg36g.1)
3) Water provider boundary shapefile (In folder for Step 1a)

Load all three datasets into QGIS and then use 'Urban_landclass_landcover_metrics.model3' to 
automate the processing steps to generate landcover rasters clipped to the NLCD LC boundaries 
for Urban LCs 21, 22, 23, and 24. 

Outputs from this procedure are located in Folder: Clipped_Provider_High_Res_Landcover
